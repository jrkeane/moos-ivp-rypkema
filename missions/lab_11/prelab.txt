a) The primary advantages of arithmetic source encoding include: flexibility (given a model with sequence of event
probabilities, arithmetic coding can be used); optimality (optimal in theory and very nearly optimal in practice)
b) the primary disadvantages of arithmetic source encoding include: speed (tends to be slow to encode); does not produce
a prefix code (disallowing parallel processing); poor error resistance
c) This encoding scheme makes sense for marine robotics because most messages are repetitive (i.e. symbol probabilities
are well known), we desire optimality (the high cost of underwater communications means we wish to compress as much
information into a single message as possible), and speed is not much of an issue (since we cannot send many messages at
once anyway)

b)  i. In a way, Google Protobuf messages and C++ classes are directly analagous - a message is defined by a set of
internal variables, from which a set of getter, setter, and checker methods are automatically produced; this is much the
same as a C++ class, where we can define internal variables and class methods.
