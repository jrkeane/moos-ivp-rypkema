1. 
a) size of DCCL message: 6 bytes; bitrate of link 25.6bps=3.2Bps; therefore min interval to send 6 bytes is 6/3.2=1.875 seconds; max_queue needed at this interval is x (every 10 seconds) (every 1.875 seconds the entire 6 bytes is sent)
b) latency between messages is ~2/3 seconds; plus some messages are not received, as messages from two sources are sent at the same time; you can either stagger messages to be sent at different times, or use two receivers set at different frequencies
c) positional/navigation information is a good example where the latest message to be sent should be prioritized (sent first), as as it is important for both operational safety and monitoring; messages that have some form of temporaral or spatial pattern may be better suited to be sent in order so as to make better sense of the data topside

2.
Assuming uniform probability of sending a message within the range (0,32768), the probability that the varint codec is worthwhile is simply ((32678-128)-128)/32768=0.98944
